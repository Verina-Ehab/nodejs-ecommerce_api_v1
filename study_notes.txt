#############The Node.js Process#############

Global Object: This refers to a special object named process that provides information
about the current Node.js process running your code. It's a core part of Node.js and offers functionalities like:

    process.argv: An array containing command-line arguments passed to your Node.js script.

    process.env: An object containing environment variables.

    process.cwd: The current working directory of the process.

    process.exit: A function to terminate the Node.js process.

    process.stdin, process.stdout, process.stderr: Streams for standard input, standard output, and standard error.

    process.nextTick: A way to schedule tasks to run after the current operation stack is cleared.

    process.memoryUsage: Information about the memory usage of the process.

    Example:

    console.log('Command Line Arguments:', process.argv); 
    console.log('Environment Variables:', process.env); 
    console.log('Current Working Directory:', process.cwd());
